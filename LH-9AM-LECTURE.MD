# Objects in JS

* Any number considered true except 0
* an empty string is falsy
* field ? word = 'not'   - checks if the variable before the question mark is true or false
* Empty array and object is true


* Nesting arrays, just know how you do it and how you access it.
* Array just index 0 - , Where as in objects you can pair values and keys. Keys must alwas be stored as strings. Or they are converted to a string automatically.
* Objects store a key and value - a pair.
* Keys have to be unique they can eb replaced by storing a new value to the same key.

* store values in objects through keys like sp
* var biz = {}
biz.array = array // stores variable array which holds an array to the key array on object biz.
biz[array] = array does the same as above.

* Objects are passed by reference.

* When you use in for a loop the value after has to be an object
